# gtd
> A simple shell script for effective time management.

## Flags

    -b : start on a break
    -c : custom command (defaults to "clear")
    -m : toggle MPD on change
    -n : notify on change
    -s : speak command
    -t : show time in tmux status bar
    -T : update time in /tmp file
    -e : specify time to end at (e.g. 2:45pm today)
    -f : specify a configuration file

## Usage

    gtd [ -bcmnstTef ] [ work length ] [ break length ]

Basically it loops infinitely between periods of work and breaks. For example...

    gtd -s 25

Will start a loop with 25 minute periods of work separated by 5 minute breaks. If you give it the `-b` flag then it starts on a break instead of a working period.

If you don't specify a break length, the script automatically determines how long breaks should be depending on how long you want your working periods to be. I usually use either 25 or 15 minute working periods depending on my mood. The basic formula it uses is just integer division divided by 5. So 25 minute periods have 5 minute breaks and 15 minute periods have 3 minute breaks. An 11 minute period will have a 2 minute break since 11/5 = 2.2 â‰ˆ 2.

## Configuration

The `-c`, `-m`, `-n`, `-s` and `-t` flags use commands. The `-m` flag uses `mpc toggle` to toggle your mpd client and the `-n` flag uses libnotify to notify when the period ends. The `-s` flag enables `espeak` to speak to you when the period changes. The `-c` flag uses a custom command, which is `clear` by default. The `-t` flag refreshes tmux and updates `/tmp/gtd-tmux` with the time status so that it can be read by tmux. Just read the file somewhere in your `tmux.conf` status bar configuration somewhere. For example:

    set-option -g status-right "#(cat /tmp/gtd-tmux) %a %m/%d %I:%M %P"

If you'd rather control a temporary file without the use of tmux you can use the `-T` flag which simply updates the time in `/tmp/gtd`.

If you have the `at` command you can use its syntax to specify an end time with the `-e` flag. For example:

    gtd -e "10:45pm today"

This will stop the script at 10:45pm today. See `man at` for more syntax options.

The script is easily modifiable to use custom programs or commands if you'd rather not use the defaults. The one exception to this is the `tmux` integration. For the others, simply set the appropriate variable when starting or in the file `~/.gtdrc`. You can use the `-f` flag if you'd like to use a different file. The configurable variables are provided below. If you use a flag after setting a boolean variable to true it will toggle it, turning it off.

    CUSTOM_CMD="clear"
    MPD_CMD="mpc -q toggle"
    NOTIFY_CMD="notify-send"
    SPEAK_CMD="&>/dev/null espeak"

    DEFAULT_WORK_LENGTH=${DEFAULT_WORK_LENGTH:-15}
    NOTIFY_WORK="\"Get things done.\""
    NOTIFY_BREAK="\"Take a break.\""
    SPEAK_WORK="$NOTIFY_WORK"
    SPEAK_BREAK="$NOTIFY_BREAK"

    # Set these to "true" to change the default
    DO_BREAK=
    DO_CUSTOM=
    DO_MPD=
    DO_NOTIFY=
    DO_SPEAK=
    DO_TMUX=
    DO_TMP_FILE=
